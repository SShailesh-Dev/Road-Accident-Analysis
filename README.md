# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (2021-2022)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes road accidents based on factors such as vehicle type, road type, location area, and surface conditions. The dataset spans 2021-2022, offering insights into accident trends, severity, and key contributing factors. **Microsoft Excel** was used for data analysis and dashboard creation.

## Key Features
- **Total Casualties**: Breakdown of total casualties into fatal, serious, and slight injuries.
- **Vehicle Type Analysis**: Casualties categorized by various vehicle types, including cars, motorcycles, buses, bicycles, and more.
- **Accident Trends**: Comparison of casualty numbers across 2021 and 2022.
- **Road Type and Surface Conditions**: Analysis of casualties based on road types (e.g., single carriageway, roundabout) and surface conditions (dry, wet, snow-covered).
- **Location and Lighting**: Comparison of casualties in rural vs. urban areas and daylight vs. dark conditions.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation.

## Dashboard Insights
1. **Total Casualties**: **417,883** casualties recorded, with **1.7% fatal**, **14.2% serious**, and **84.1% slight**.
2. **Casualty Trends**: Casualty numbers were stable from 2021 to 2022, with slight monthly variations.
3. **Vehicle Involvement**: Cars accounted for **79.8%** of total casualties.
4. **Accidents by Road Type**: Single carriageways saw the majority of accidents with **309.7k** casualties.
5. **Surface Conditions**: More accidents occurred on dry roads (**279,445 casualties**) than on wet surfaces (**115,261 casualties**).

## How to View the Dashboard
The dashboard is interactive, allowing filtering by:
- **Accident date** (yearly and quarterly).
- **Rural vs. urban areas**.
